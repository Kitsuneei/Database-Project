<h3>External Merge Sort Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the python source files related to external merge sort (top_k_with_external_merge_sort.py, external_merge_sort_randomized_test.py, top_k_optimized_ex_merge_on_datasets.py).</li>
            <li>Only external_merge_sort_randomized_test.py and top_k_optimized_ex_merge_on_datasets.py should be run. The first class file is instantiated in the two drivers. Below are the instructions and experiemnt details.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Experiment details</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>These instructions refer to the python file external_merge_sort_randomized_test.py</li>
                <li>You may run the code as is. It is verbose in the console by nature, but metrics will also be generated in a table_metrics.csv file.</li>
                <li>You may change the parameters within the code itself (M, B, K, N) to valid values. The code will alert if the values are invalid. The original values are what was used in our paper.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    <h4>Experiment details</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>These instructions refer to the python file top_k_optimized_ex_merge_on_datasets.py.</li>
                <li>Download the XML datasets in the repository.</li>
                <li>Unzip and rename the files such that they can be read via the python code.</li>
                <li>You may run the code as is. It is verbose in the console by nature, and multiple metrics files named dataset_metrics_K_N.csv where K and N are integer parameters will be generated.</li>
                <li>You may change the set of K_N_combos in the code itself. The original list enumerates all the test cases described in our paper.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>


<h3>Histogram Approach</h3>
    <h4>Experiment details</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the python codes (top_k_with_histogramv3-Table1.py - top_k_with_histogramv3-Table5.py)</li>
            <li>Run the codes as is. The results from the report should be generated as a csv file under the same directory.</li>
         </ol> 
    </p>
    <h4>Experiment details</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the python code (top_k_with_histogramv3-Comparison.py)</li>
            <li>Download the XML files under the repository.</li>
            <li>Unzip and rename the files as indicated in the python code.</li>
            <li>Run the code as is. The results will be populated in the console.</li>
        </ol>
